## Approach

### Make it work

1. Visualize the problem as a tree.
2. Implement the tree into a recursive solution.
3. Define the base case(s) as the leaves of the tree.
4. Test the solution.

### Make it efficient

1. Add memoization to the recursive solution.
2. Add conditions to store and return memoized values.
